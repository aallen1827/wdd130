    <p>Hi I'm Alex. I am from El Paso, Texas. The summers can sometimes get pretty hot, but the fall and winter have nice weather.</p>
    <p>I plan on getting a degree in computer science so I can eventually get a job as a programmer.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include playing musical instruments, such as viola, guitar, and ukulele, and playing sports and disk golf. I also enjoy programming. I know some basic Python. I am taking this class because it is required for my degree and I think it will be an interesting class.</p>
    <P>I am looking forward to this class and I hope I will be able to learn some useful skills.</P>
