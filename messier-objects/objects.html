                <h2>How to Observe</h2>
                <p>All of the objects can be observed from the Northern Hemisphere. Some are even visible to the naked eye. Naked eye objects include M45 (the Pleaides), M42 (the Great Nebula in Orion), and if youâ€™re lucky M31 (the Andromeda Galaxy). Many other objects can be observed with binoculars, but to see all of them you will need a telescope.</p>

                <h2>Galaxies</h2>
                <p>The majority of items in the Messier Catalogue are galaxies. 40 of the 110 objects are galaxies. 24 of the galaxies are spiral shaped, 8 are elliptical, and the rest are either barred or lenticular. To observe galaxies, you need a dark sky with very low light pollution. It is better to have a larger telescope to observe them because they will be able to collect more light. The largest and brightest galaxy from Earth is the Andromeda Galaxy.</p>

                <h2>Nebulae</h2>
                <p>11 of the objects are nebulae. These are clouds of dust in space that reflect the light from nearby stars. There are two types of nebulae, diffuse and planetary. Diffuse nebulae are irregularly shaped and have no clearly defined boundaries. 7 of the nebulae, such as the Orion Nebula (M42), are diffuse. The other 4 are planetary nebulae. These nebulae are created by stars expelling their outward layers. These nebulae normally have fairly regular and symmetrical shapes. The ring nebula (M57) is an example of this.</p>

                <h2>Star Clusters</h2>
                <p>The Messier Catalogue contains 2 types of star clusters, open and globular. Open clusters are large and contain 10s to 1000s of stars. The Pleiades (M45) is an example. Globular clusters are much closer together and contain many more stars. They can contain 10s of thousands to millions of stars. A famous globular cluster is the Great Hercules Cluster (M13).</p>

                <h2>Other Objects</h2>
                <p>4 of the objects in the Catalogue are unique. The Crab Nebula (M1) is a supernova remnant. M73 is an asterism, basically a small constellation. M24 is a bright star cloud in the Milky Way. M40 is one of the weirdest objects. Charles Messier had been told that there was a deep sky object at its location. He looked around, but the only object he could see was a faint double star. He decided to catalogue it anyway.</p>
