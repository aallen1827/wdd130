        What is a Messier Object?
        <br>
        A Messier Object is a deep sky object, such as galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters. Charles Messier created a list of 110 of these objects that was published in 1774.
        <br>
        <br>
        Who is Charles Messier?
        <br>
        Charles Messier was a French astronomer who lived from 1730 to 1817. He spent his time searching for and cataloguing comets. While doing this, he encountered many objects that looked like comets, but didn’t move. He created a list of these objects so that he and other comet hunters wouldn’t waste their time looking at them. This list eventually became known as the Messier Catalogue and is used by astronomers to this day.

      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>
        How to Observe
        <br>
        All of the objects can be observed from the Northern Hemisphere. Some are even visible to the naked eye. Naked eye objects include M45 (the Pleaides), M42 (the Great Nebula in Orion), and if you’re lucky M31 (the Andromeda Galaxy). Many other objects can be observed with binoculars, but to see all of them you will need a telescope.
        <br>
        <br>
        Galaxies
        <br>
        The majority of items in the Messier Catalogue are galaxies. 40 of the 110 objects are galaxies. 24 of the galaxies are spiral shaped, 8 are elliptical, and the rest are either barred or lenticular. To observe galaxies, you need a dark sky with very low light pollution. It is better to have a larger telescope to observe them because they will be able to collect more light. The largest and brightest galaxy from Earth is the Andromeda Galaxy.
        <br>
        <br>
        Nebulae
        <br>
        11 of the objects are nebulae. These are clouds of dust in space that reflect the light from nearby stars. There are two types of nebulae, diffuse and planetary. Diffuse nebulae are irregularly shaped and have no clearly defined boundaries. 7 of the nebulae, such as the Orion Nebula (M42), are diffuse. The other 4 are planetary nebulae. These nebulae are created by stars expelling their outward layers. These nebulae normally have fairly regular and symmetrical shapes. The ring nebula (M57) is an example of this.
        <br>
        <br>
        Star Clusters
        <br>
        The Messier Catalogue contains 2 types of star clusters, open and globular. Open clusters are large and contain 10s to 1000s of stars. The Pleiades (M45) is an example. Globular clusters are much closer together and contain many more stars. They can contain 10s of thousands to millions of stars. A famous globular cluster is the Great Hercules Cluster (M13).
        <br>
        <br>
        Other Objects
        <br>
        4 of the objects in the Catalogue are unique. The Crab Nebula (M1) is a supernova remnant. M73 is an asterism, basically a small constellation. M24 is a bright star cloud in the Milky Way. M40 is one of the weirdest objects. Charles Messier had been told that there was a deep sky object at its location. He looked around, but the only object he could see was a faint double star. He decided to catalogue it anyway.

      <h3>Observing</h3>
      <p>
        When to Look
        <br>
        Messier objects can be seen year-round, but there are some better times to look for specific objects. Autumn and Winter have many open clusters, nebulae, and a few galaxies. In the Spring, the majority of the galaxies are visible and high in the sky. The summer offers many globular clusters among other objects.
        <br>
        <br>
        Favorite Objects
        <br>
        The first Messier Object I ever saw was the Orion Nebula (M42). This is one of my favorite objects because of its brightness and how easy it is to find. Another great object is the Ring Nebula (57). This object looks like a faint smoke ring. It is fairly easy to find, but it may take a bit of practice to observe. The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is the brightest galaxy. This object always is nice to look at. My overall favorite object is M35. This is an open star cluster in the constellation Gemini.
